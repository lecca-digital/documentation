# Workflows

**Workflows in Lecca.io allow you to automate tasks by connecting various triggers and actions.**

## Workflow Triggers

<Callout type="info">
  For in depth understanding of Triggers go to our [Trigger
  documentation](/triggers)
</Callout>

Workflows all start with a trigger. There are custom triggers like "Manually Run" and "Trigger by Agent," or you can use different triggers offered by our app integrations.

- **Custom Triggers:** Like manually running or triggering by an agent.
- **App Integration Triggers:** Utilize triggers from integrated apps.

Triggers are either activated by:

- **Webhook:** Instant triggering.
- **Polling:** Default polling interval of 15 minutes for Starter plan, or 5 for Professional and Team, and 1 minute for Business plan users.

## Workflow Actions

<Callout type="info">
  For in depth understanding of Actions go to our [Action
  documentation](/actions)
</Callout>

Once a workflow is triggered, all the actions in the workflow are executed sequentially.

**Action Types:**

- **Custom Actions:**: Run an AI Agent
- **App Integration Actions:** Utilize actions from integrated apps.

When adding an app integration trigger or action, you'll need to authorize the integration. If no connection exists, you can create one within the workflow or on the conenctions page. [Learn more about connections](/connections).

## Execution and Debugging

Every workflow run creates an execution, where the actual workflow that ran can be viewed, inspected, and debugged. [Learn more about executions](/executions).

## Creating a Workflow

Workflows are created within a project and can be disabled to pause the triggers.

<Steps>
### Select a project
 
Create or select a project.
 
### Start with a trigger
 
Add a trigger to your workflow.
 
### Then add actions
 
Add app actions to your workflow.
 
### Add connections 
 
If you need to make connections, make the connections directly from your node configuration form.
 
### Test & Debug
 
Test and debug your workflow.

### Save

Saving a node saves the entire workflow, but you can also save the workflow by clicking the save button on the top right.

</Steps>

## Mapping outputs to inputs

When you add a trigger or action to a workflow, you can save it and test it to see if it works as expected. Once you do this you can map the output to an actions input.

<Steps>
### Select the node
 
Open the node configuration by clicking on the action or trigger node.
 
### Open the dropdown
 
Click the **Save & Test** button to open a dropdown.
 
### Select mock or real data.
 
Select either **Use Mock Data** or **Use Real Data**.

<Callout type="info">
  1. **Use Mock Data:** Returns a sample response 2. **Use Real Data:** Creates
  a real call to the app integration endpoint and returns the real response.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  Once you have ran **Save & Test**, you can map the response to another action
  or trigger input.
</Callout>
### Test & Debug Test and debug your workflow.

### Save

Saving a node saves the entire workflow, but you can also save the workflow by clicking the save button on the top right.

</Steps>

<Callout>
  A node is an action or a trigger in a workflow. When you add a trigger or
  action to a workflow, you are adding a node.
