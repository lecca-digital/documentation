# Workflows in Lecca.io

Lecca.io's Workflow tools allow you to automate a series of actions. Workflows can split paths, conditionally execute steps, schedule tasks, wait for human intervention, and much more.

## Getting Started

Creating an effective workflow starts with understanding its purpose. Here are the three primary reasons you might create a workflow on Lecca.io:

1. **Automate Sequential Tasks**: Trigger a series of predefined automation steps.
2. **Invoke AI Agents**: Use the "Message Agent" action to initiate an AI Agent.
3. **Tool for AI Agents**: Define a manual trigger with the "Manually Run" action and optionally utilize the "Output Workflow Data" action to interact with the AI Agent.

To ensure that you can make the most of workflows, follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Plan Your Workflow

Determine the purpose of your workflow from the three options outlined above.

### Step 2: Configure Triggers and Actions

Choose a trigger that initiates the workflow and define subsequent actions.

### Step 3: Integrate with Applications

When adding steps that need to connect to third-party apps:

- Select from existing connections within the project or workspace.
- Or create a new connection.

### Step 4: Fill out the form

Every trigger and action has a form to configure the step.

### Step 5: Use Outputs and Variables

When configuring steps, dynamically input outputs from previous steps or preset variables. These will update as the workflow executes.

### Step 6: Test and Troubleshoot

After configuring each step, click **Save**. For testing:

- Use **Save & Test** to trial with either mock data or real data.
- Mock data mimics expected results, while real data performs actual operations.
- Monitor the workflow's execution via the Executions page for effective troubleshooting.
