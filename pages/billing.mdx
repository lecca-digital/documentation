# Billing and Credits

**Welcome to the Billing and Credits page for Lecca.io! Here, we will explain how credits work and how they are used in your AI Agents and Workflow Automation tools.**

<Callout type="info">
  If you have any questions about billing or your credits, feel free to reach
  out to our support team at [support@lecca.io](mailto:support@lecca.io).

### Daily Allotment

Different payment plans receive a different daily allotment of tokens.

**Starter** receives **7,000** per day.

**Professional** receives **200,000** per day.

**Team** receives **800,000** per day.

<Callout>
  However, note that only the **default created workspace** of a user gets this
  monthly allotment when on a starter (free) plan. This policy prevents the
  creation of unlimited workspaces with free credits.

### AI Agent Usage

Credits are used as AI tokens when you converse with or have your AI Agent
perform a task. Each interaction or task consumes a specified number of
credits.
