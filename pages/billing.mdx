# Billing and Credits

**Welcome to the Billing and Credits page for Lecca.io! Here, we will explain how credits work and how they are used in your AI Agents and Workflow Automation tools.**

<Callout type="info">
  If you have any questions about billing or your credits, feel free to reach
  out to our support team at [support@lecca.io](mailto:support@lecca.io).

<Steps>

### Monthly Allotment

All payment plans receive a monthly allotment of **100,000 credits**.
However, note that only the **default created workspace** of a user gets
this monthly allotment. This policy prevents the creation of unlimited
workspaces with free credits.

### AI Agent Usage

Credits are used as AI tokens when you converse with or have your AI Agent
perform a task. Each interaction or task consumes a specified number of
credits.

### Purchasing Additional Credits

If you require more credits than the monthly allotment, you can purchase
additional credits separately. Your purchased credits do not reset every
month, unlike the monthly allotment which does.

### Workflow Usage

Credits are also utilized when you execute workflows. The number of credits
consumed is determined by the time a step takes to execute.

  Important: Monitor your credit usage to avoid running out of credits in the
  middle of critical tasks. Make sure to purchase additional credits as needed.
