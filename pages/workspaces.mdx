## Overview

Everything in Lecca.io is organized within a Workspace. Key components such as projects, workflows, AI agents, connections, variables, and knowledge notebooks are created and managed within a Workspace. Access to these components is restricted to users who have access to the corresponding Workspace.

  Access to a Workspace determines the visibility and interaction level with all
  items contained within it.

## Creating and Managing Workspaces

### Default Workspace

Every user in Lecca.io starts with a default Workspace. This primary Workspace is crucial as it is the only Workspace that receives credits on the free tier. Therefore, it cannot be deleted. During onboarding, users will be prompted to join any Workspaces to which they have been invited.

### Inviting and Joining Workspaces

Users can view and accept any pending Workspace invitations on their account page. This functionality helps maintain a collaborative environment within your organization.

## Workspace Configuration

Users with the role of a Maintainer have the capability to configure Workspace settings.

### Workspace Roles

Lecca.io distinguishes two roles within a Workspace:

- **Maintainer**: Has full access to view and interact with all items within the Workspace.
- **Member**: Can view and interact with their own projects and items set at a Workspace level.

  Assign roles wisely to ensure the security and privacy of your projects and
  data.
</Callout>

### Projects and Resources in Workspaces

Projects in Lecca.io are housed within a Workspace. Additionally, variables, connections, and knowledge notebooks can be created and accessed at both project and Workspace levels. This flexibility ensures that resources can be shared among all Workspace members if needed.
