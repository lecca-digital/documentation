# Triggers

Triggers initiate workflows and can be either polling-based or webhook-based.

## Types of Triggers

### Polling

- **Non-Business Plan**: Checks for updates every 5 minutes.
- **Business Plan**: Checks for updates every 1 minute.

### Webhooks

Webhook triggers fire instantly once our servers receive the trigger from the app.

## Adding a Trigger to a Workflow

When adding a trigger to a workflow, follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Step 1
 
Add your desired trigger to the workflow.

## Agent Triggers

Agent triggers behave similarly to workflow triggers. The output of an agent's trigger is sent as a prompt to the agent. Based on its instructions and available apps/tools, it will determine what action to take next.
