# Knowledge Notebooks

**Lecca.io Knowledge Notebooks enable you to store and reuse valuable knowledge from your interactions with AI Agents, ultimately enhancing the agent's responses.**

## Configuring Knowledge Notebooks

When setting up an AI Agent, you can enable various knowledge notebooks. This allows the agent to save and utilize knowledge relevant to your use cases.

  interactions are not lost and can be retrieved whenever needed.

## Plan Limitations and Data Usage

- Starter Plan: Limited to 1 knowledge notebook.

- Professional Plan, Team, and Business: Allows creation of multiple knowledge notebooks for various use cases. When
  saving data to a knowledge notebook, it consumes credits based on the size of the
  content. Organize your knowledge into different notebooks to facilitate faster and
  more accurate data retrieval.

<Callout>
  There's an advantage in creating dedicated notebooks for different topics or
  use cases, enhancing the efficiency of your AI Agent.{' '}

Future Enhancements We have plans to integrate knowledge notebooks into our workflows,
further extending their utility and automation capabilities.
