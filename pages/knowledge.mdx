## Configuring Knowledge Notebooks

When setting up an AI Agent, you can enable various knowledge notebooks. This allows the agent to save and utilize knowledge relevant to your use cases.

## Utilizing Saved Knowledge

In future conversations, when you ask your AI Agent questions, the agent will reference the relevant knowledge stored in the notebooks to provide more precise and informed answers.

<Callout type="info">
  The agent's ability to reference saved knowledge makes interactions more
  efficient and ensures continuity in the information provided.{' '}

## Plan Limitations and Data Usage

- Starter Plan: Limited to 1 knowledge notebook.

- Professional and Team Plan: Allows creation of multiple knowledge notebooks for various use cases. When
  saving data to a knowledge notebook, it consumes credits based on the size of the
  content. Organize your knowledge into different notebooks to facilitate faster and
  more accurate data retrieval.

<Callout>
  There's an advantage in creating dedicated notebooks for different topics or
  use cases.
