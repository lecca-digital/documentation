# Actions

**Actions are essential components within workflows and tools that AI Agents can utilize. They receive inputs to execute specific app actions.**

## Inputs

All actions require some form of input to function:
- **Workflows**: Inputs are either manually entered or mapped from the output of a previous node.
- **AI Agents**: Inputs are provided by the AI Agent. If additional information is needed, the agent will prompt for it.

<Callout emoji="⚙️">
  Note: Ensure your inputs are accurate to avoid errors in action execution.
</Callout>

## Example Usage

<Tabs items={['Workflow', 'Agent']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Workflow Example
    
    In a workflow, you might have an action that sends an email. The input could be mapped from data received in a previous step.

<Steps>
    ### Select app connection
    ### Enter subject
    ### Enter body
    ### Enter recipient email
    ### Enter other fields
    </Steps>
    
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Agent Example
    
    An AI Agent might need to send an email. It will use its internal logic and ask for any missing information if required.

    <Steps>
        ### You ask agent to send email
        ### Agent asks for subject, recipient email, and body
        ### Agent sends email
    </Steps>

    **Or you can tell the agent to send an email about a specific topic to an email address and it will generate it's own content (or look up the content using it's provided apps/tools) and subject line**
    
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
