# Actions

**Actions are essential components within workflows and tools that AI Agents can utilize. They receive inputs to execute specific app actions.**

## Inputs

All actions require some form of input to function:

- **Workflows**: Inputs are either manually entered or mapped from the output of a previous node.
- **AI Agents**: Inputs are provided by the AI Agent. If additional information is needed, the agent will prompt for it.

<Callout emoji="⚙️">
  Note: Ensure your inputs are accurate to avoid errors in action execution.
</Callout>

## Example Usage

<Tabs items={['Workflow', 'Agent']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Workflow Example
    
    In a workflow, you might have an action that sends an email. The input could be mapped from data received in a previous step.

    <div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden', marginTop: '20px' }}>
      <iframe width="560" height="315"             style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBq74YfBhXQ?si=m1NDIx7AiJZz_DrJ" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowFullScreen></iframe>
    </div>

<Steps>
    ### Select app connection
    ### Enter subject
    ### Enter body
    ### Enter recipient email
    ### Enter other fields
    </Steps>
    
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Agent Example
    
    An AI Agent might need to send an email. It will use its internal logic and ask for any missing information if required.

    <Steps>
        ### You ask agent to send email
        ### Agent asks for subject, recipient email, and body
        ### Agent sends email
    </Steps>

    **Or you can tell the agent to send an email about a specific topic to an email address and it will generate it's own content (or look up the content using it's provided apps/tools) and subject line**

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
