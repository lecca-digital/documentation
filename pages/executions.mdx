# Executions

Executions are created when a workflow is triggered. Each execution provides a history of the workflow that ran.

## Execution History

The execution history is useful for:
- Debugging steps
- Viewing the output of different steps

If an execution fails, it will indicate why it failed and you can examine the specific step where the failure occurred.

- **Starter Plan:** 1 Week
