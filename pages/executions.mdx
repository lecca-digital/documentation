    ## Overview

    Each Execution represents a specific instance of a workflow execution. When a workflow is triggered, an Execution is created and logged on the Executions page.

    ## Managing Executions

    On the Executions page, you will have access to important information, such as:

    - **Start and End Times:** Monitor the duration of each workflow execution.
    - **Status:** Track the current state of the execution, whether it’s running, completed, or encountered an error.
    - **Referenced Workflow:** Quickly identify which workflow is being executed.

    Executions are initiated when a trigger step within the workflow is activated. For more details on setting up triggers, visit the [Triggers documentation](/triggers).

### Viewing Execution Details

To get a detailed view of each execution:

1. Navigate to the **Executions Page** from the main dashboard.
2. Observe the list of executions with their respective start and end times, status, and referenced workflows.
3. If an execution is still running, it will be marked accordingly, allowing you to track its progress in real-time.
4. Should there be any errors within an execution, error outputs will be displayed for effective debugging.

### Debugging and Error Handling

Upon encountering errors in a workflow execution:

- Locate the specific execution on the Executions page.
- Inspect the error outputs to diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

This process is crucial for maintaining seamless workflow operations and ensuring each step executes as intended.
