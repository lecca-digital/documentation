# Executions

Executions are created when a workflow is triggered. Each execution provides a history of the workflow that ran.

## Execution History

The execution history is useful for:

- Debugging steps
- Viewing the output of different steps

If an execution fails, it will indicate why it failed and you can examine the specific step where the failure occurred.

The history of executions varies depending on your plan.

- **Starter Plan:** 1 Week
- **Professional Plan:** 1 Month
- **Team Plan:** 1 Month
