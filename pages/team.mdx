# Team

**Manage your team members within your workspaces and projects**

## Roles

There are 2 types of roles, **Maintainers** and **Members**.

### Maintainer

1. Can invite and remove team members to/from the workspace. This is not the same as inviting to a project. All members of a project can invite users to a project.
2. Can update the workspace subscription plan and update payment methods.
3. Can view all projects, executions, connections, variables, .etc.

<Callout>
  Maintainers can view and perform actions on anything within their workspace.
  Including projects they're not explicitly invited to.
</Callout>

### Member

1. Cannot invite new members to the workspace.
2. Can only access projects they've been invited to.
3. Cannot view workspace overview or workspace billing information.

## Inviting Team Members

<Callout type="info">
  On the **Starter** or **Professional** plans, you can only have one team
  member in your workspace. Upgrade to the **Team** plans to invite additional
  members.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Step 1: Open Invitation Form

To invite a team member to your workspace, select **Invite** on the overview page or in the Workspace Settings page.

### Step 2. Enter Email

Enter the email address of the person you want to invite.

### Step 3. Choose Role

Choose their role from the dropdown menu. You can choose from **Maintainer** or **Member**.

</Steps>

Inviting team members will give them access to your workspace connections and variables.

If they need access to project-specific workflows, AI Agents, connections, or variables, you'll need to invite them to those specific projects separately.
